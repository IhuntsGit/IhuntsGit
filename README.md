# Hello Y'all!
### Learn more about me:

##### What is your alias?
- I go by a few names, but I prefer the term "Ihunts".
##### How old are you? Are you still in school?
- I'm currently 17 years old. And yes I am still in school. I will be graduating this school year. *(in 2025)*
##### What are you interested in?
- I'm interested in Video Games and how they're created.
- I'm also interested in the automotive industry, and how all things "mechanics" work.
##### What skills do you have?
- I consider myself a beginner programmer. I have made several "test projects", but in most of them it's just me screwing around with either the Unity, or Unreal game engines. I know a little C# and Python, but I would like to start learning languages like C++.
- I also develop Minecraft Resource Packs as a pastime.
##### Anything you'd like to share?
- Well, I do have a YouTube channel. I post videos there about video games that I play, or "YouTube Poop" edits. I don't have a determined schedule for posting **yet.** I also stream on Twitch occasionally.
##### Why are there several "Ihunts" acounts on Github?
- They're all my accounts, but I've lost access to them either because I was being an idiot *(which happens a lot)*, or because my Authenticator app forgot how codes work. This one *hopefully* will be my main account that I will post to. So *please* do not report my account for stolen content. Because I made all the accounts LOL.
##### Are you planning on joining a Game Development studio, or something similar?
- No, I don't intend on joining any studios at the moment. Maybe in a few years time when my knowledge on Game Engines grows big enough, I'll join a small team.
